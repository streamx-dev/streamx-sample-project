# StreamX Sample Project

This project contains sample implementations of StreamX to demonstrate how to use StreamX.
These services can be used to create sample StreamX mesh.

Full documentation is available on https://www.streamx.dev/guides/index.html.

## Project structure

Each StreamX project should be organized in a specific way and should follow the conventions described below.

The following are recommended directories:

* [data](./data/README.md) - sample data should be placed here
* [mesh](./mesh/README.md) - resources required to configure and run StreamX Mesh
* [scripts](./scripts/README.md) - all useful scripts and resources should be placed here
* [services](./services/README.md) - your StreamX Processing and Delivery Services (as well as other Maven modules) should be placed here

## Prerequisites

To work with this repository you need:
* OpenJDK 17+ installed with JAVA_HOME configured appropriately
* Docker
* StreamX CLI

### StreamX CLI

To install StreamX CLI, run:
```sh
# for Linux/MacOS
brew install streamx-dev/tap/streamx
```
or
```shell
# for Windows
scoop bucket add streamx-dev https://github.com/streamx-dev/scoop-streamx-dev.git
scoop install streamx
```

To upgrade StreamX CLI, run:
```sh
# for Linux/MacOS
brew update
brew upgrade streamx
```
or
```shell
# for Windows
scoop update streamx
```

For more information, visit [StreamX CLI Reference](https://www.streamx.dev/guides/streamx-command-line-interface-reference.html#_installing_the_cli).

## Packaging

To build StreamX project, run:
```shell
# For Linux/MacOS
./mvnw clean install
```
or 
```shell
# For Windows
mvnw.cmd clean install
```

This command builds both the Maven artefacts and the Docker images needed to start the local StreamX mesh.

## Running local StreamX Mesh

To start local instance of Mesh run:

```shell
cd mesh
streamx run
```
The above command runs the StreamX mesh defined in the `mesh.yaml` file located in the current directory.
For more information, visit [StreamX CLI Reference](https://www.streamx.dev/guides/streamx-command-line-interface-reference.html#_streamx_run).

## Ingesting local mesh with sample data

Optionally run script to trigger sample publications and see results:

```bash
streamx batch publish data
```

To see results of publication - visit:
* [Generated pages](http://localhost:8081/products.html) 
* [GraphQL Console](http://localhost:8084/q/graphql-ui/) and launch some queries (details in [GraphqlDeliveryService](./services/graphql-delivery-service/README.md))

For more information, visit [StreamX CLI Reference](https://www.streamx.dev/guides/streamx-command-line-interface-reference.html#_streamx_batch).

## Debugging

If you need to debug a single service as part of the StreamX Mesh, you need to comment out debugged service in your mesh YAML  
e.g. to debug `graphql-delivery-service` comment out such fragment as below:

```yaml
delivery:
#  graphql:
#    image: graphql-delivery-service
#    incoming:
#      products:
#        topic: outboxes/products
#    port: 8084
  web:
    image: web-delivery-service
    incoming:
      pages:
        topic: outboxes/pages
      web-resources:
        topic: outboxes/web-resources
    port: 8081
```

Then, run your mesh using standard `streamx run` command:
```shell
cd mesh
streamx run
```

Finally make sure that the `application-streamx-mesh-debug.properties` file in the debugged service reflects the mesh configuration (topics configuration, exposed port, etc.). 
Then run the debugged service with the `streamx-mesh-debug` profile, e.g. for `graphql-delivery-service` run the following command: 
```shell
cd services/graphql-delivery-service
quarkus dev -Dquarkus.profile=streamx-mesh-debug
```
