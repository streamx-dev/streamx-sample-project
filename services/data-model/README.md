# Data Model

This Maven module contains Java classes representing message payloads that are used in `@Incoming`/`@Outgoing` channels.

As StreamX is using Avro to serialize, each class must be annotated with `org.apache.avro.specific.@AvroGenerated`.
Each model class also needs empty constructor.

`data-model` is shared with other modules as a dependency.
To be useful, the assembled JAR file must contain Jandex metadata.
The metadata is generated by the `jandex-maven-plugin`, which is configured in the `pom.xml` file.
